        <h2>☛Early life</h2>
        <p><center>Sharma was born on 30 April 1987 in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra.His mother, Purnima Sharma, is from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.
              His father, Gurunath Sharma, worked as a caretaker of a transport firm storehouse. Sharma was raised by his grandparents and uncles in Borivali because of his father's low income. 
              He would visit his parents, who lived in a single-room house in Dombivli, only during weekends. He has a younger brother, Vishal Sharma.</p></center>
<br>
<h3>☛Youth and domestic first-class career</h3>
<p><center>Sharma made his List A debut for West Zone against Central Zone in the Deodhar Trophy at Gwalior in March 2005. Batting at number eight, he scored 31 not out as West Zone won by 3 wickets with 24 balls remaining.
     Cheteshwar Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja made their debuts in the same match.It was Sharma's unbeaten innings of 142 in 123 balls against North Zone at the Maharanna Bhupal College Ground in Udaipur in the same tournament that brought him into the limelight.
     He visited Abu Dhabi and Australia with the India A squad and was then included among India's 30-member probables list for the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy tournament, although he did not make the final squad.</p></center>

<h4>☛International career</h4>
<p><center>Test matches
    In November 2013, during Sachin Tendulkar's farewell series, Sharma made his Test debut at Eden Gardens in Kolkata against West Indies and scored 177, the second-highest score on debut by an Indian to Shikhar Dhawan (187). He followed it up with 111 (not out) in the second Test at his home ground, the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.Having been out of the Test team since 2017–18, Sharma went on the 2018–19 tour of Australia after he had earned a recall earlier.  Chief selector M. S. K. Prasad said the reason for his recall was that his natural game suited the bouncy Australian pitches.
   Sharma played in the first Test in Adelaide, scoring 37 and 1 in an Indian victory.During the first Test, he sustained a minor injury which saw him miss the second Test in Perth.     He recovered for the Boxing Day third Test at Melbourne and scored 63 (not out) to help India total 443/7 and win both the Test and the series.</p></center>

<h6>☛PLAYING STYLE</h6>
<p><center>Sharma is an aggressive batsman but plays with style and elegance.
    He is usually an opening batsman in limited overs cricket, but has played most of his Test cricket as a middle-order batsman.
     In limited overs cricket, Sharma is widely recognised as one of the format's most outstanding batsmen.
     And for his attacking batting and six hitting abilities he often referred as Hitman.
     Sunil Gavaskar considers Sharma to have a batting style similar to those of Virender Sehwag and Viv Richards. 
     In his column for The Times of India in November 2018, Gavaskar said:</p></center>
